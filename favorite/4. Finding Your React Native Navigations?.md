# Finding Your React Native Navigations?

Original.

Here is a list for navigations we have used. React-navigation & react-native-router-flux are the choice in many of our projects(most recommended). You can also try react-native-navigation if necessary. Hope React-navigation or react-native-router-flux  can fit your project already. 

1. React-navigation **popular choice for many projects, learning hell**
   - **JS-based solution**, easy to use in project. Good documentation. 
   - Need redux integration

1. react-native-navigation **good, but challenging things**
   - **Native based solution**. Abundant API.
   - A lot of changing & learning and issues to fix if you decide to use it. Big changing in V2, but V2 is not released yet.

2. react-native-router-flux **easier life for developers**
   - **React-navigation based JS solution**. Flux integrated. Simpler to use than React-navigation. Has been used in many previous projects.
   - based on React Navigation v1.5.6. May have the risk for latest React native.

3. react-native-routy **do not use it**
   - No much choices at that time (2016), so we created it.
   - No one mantains
